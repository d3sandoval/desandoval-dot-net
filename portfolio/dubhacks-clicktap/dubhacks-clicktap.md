In the fall of 2015, the University of Washington held [the DubHacks hackathon](http://15f.dubhacks.co/). DubHacks is the largest collegiate hackathon in the Pacific Northwest where "top college hackers will gather at the University of Washington to build the next generation of innovative software and hardware hacks."

For this project, I teamed up with a couple of iOS developers to create a fun social media networking game similar to Facebook's "poke". Think a ["yo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(app)) but with gamification! That was the plan...

> With ClickTap, we've combined a social ranking platform with a consolidated friends list to provide inspiration for interactive discovery. In our design, we hope to appeal to two of people's most innate urges (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753613)... the desire for social validation and the need to tap our screens into oblivion!

More info on the [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/clicktap) bio I wrote for our team.

The iOS hackers on my team had a hard time setting up their development environment and we ended up spending most of the hackathon talking to recruiters and making friends. When it came time to actually get to work, I pulled together a prototype of the application so that we had something to show for our idea:

This prototype simulates the key concepts of the application and was designed, prototyped and guerilla user tested in &lt;2 hours.

## Feature list
1. User can sync Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts to find friends or add from their contacts
2. Friends on the app can be "Tapped" which will increase their total "Taps"
3. You can add users who you do not know on social media by searching through the friends lists of the people you do know
4. Suggested friends (who are friends of friends) will appear at the bottom of the home screen, below your list of current friends
5. Suggested friends can be added by dragging them into your list of current friends - this will let you "Tap" them and increase your score

> The goal of the app is that people will "Tap" other people and those people will be encouraged to "Tap back". **Outside of the app, people could compare the amount of "Taps" they have for bragging rights and all-around fun.**

## Lessons learned
1. Make sure your team has XCode installed before attempting to start a 24hr long hackathon
2. Start stringing together your prototype early and rebuild it, often. Nothing is worse than trying to link up an app full of screens at the last minute...
3. The InVision support team is really responsive! s/o to their Customer Success team:
