These projects were designed and executed in order to meet the following skill objectives:

*   Analyze a design and determine the most appropriate and useful prototyping technique to evaluate the design.
*   Research, locate, and use information sources for self-education in prototyping tools.
*   Plan, create, and build a prototype system on a wide variety of platforms, using appropriate toolsets.
*   Organize, run, and document a simple user test using prototypes they have constructed.
*   Evaluate the results of user tests, and analyze and report on them in a professional manner.
*   Understand the significance of the test results and use that to inform their design process.
*   Articulate the rationale for prototyping in general as a design tool, and be able to advise others on strategies and techniques.

[This website](http://protopro.tumblr.com) was created to chronicle my prototyping process during the course, **HCDE 498: Prototyping Techniques**

Prototyping is the process of developing a preliminary version of a solution to a design problem in order to communicate the essence of the idea before committing to a more costly implementation. A simpler version, in lower fidelity than a final product, allows the designer to verify assumptions, gather user feedback, and evaluate the design in early stages of the process.

This course introduced students to a wide variety of prototyping techniques for different kinds of user experience design problems and platforms. The course was structured as a series of independent explorations, each on a different topic within the broad field of prototyping techniques. A [short final project](http://protopro.tumblr.com/post/120676452388/2d-object-paper-prototype-a-sheet-music-player) required that we develop and evaluate a prototype for a design project, using one or more of the techniques explored during the course.
